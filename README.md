# ShadowFox_Internship
Participated in Shadow Fox's Python development internship program.

Playing Hangman sparked my curiosity about game design strategies. While I'd always enjoyed playing games, I'd never built one myself. After learning about game development, I was surprised by how engaging Hangman could be without any graphics.

Secondly, Web Scraping captivated me more as it combined the thrill of discovery with the process of pulling data from websites.

The ShadowFox mentorship program was particularly beneficial. They didn't just answer questions; they actively engaged with students' doubts, providing a range of solutions and guiding us through the process of selecting the most effective approach.
